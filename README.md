These files contain the datasets that can be used for training the model.

The files in Original Dataset contain 19999 oxides between the band gap of 1 - 6 eV, this file contains both metals and non - metals

The files in Metallic Oxides contain 4388 elements and doesnt contain non-metals

Both the folders also contain an atom_init file that has the data on feature vectors and an id_prop file which is an excel file containing the CIF file name and respective band gap value
